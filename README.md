1. Basic ArithmeticPlease calculate the following equation and store to variable z1

I : identity matrix.

2. Matrix/Vector We know that12 34 âˆ’4A = [34 7 87]3 65 71 4 7B = [2 5 8] 3 6 9Find(a) z2 = A*B,(b) z3 = A.*B(c) z4 = A^3,(d) z5 = A.^3(e) z6 = [A([1,3],:);B^2](f) z7 = a vector contains eigenvalues of B(g) z8 = determinant of A

3. Equation Solving

Solve x1, x2, x3. Then change 0.52 to 0.53 and solve again.

4. Loop statementPlease create a 9*9 Hilbert matrixReference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_matrix
